TL;DR: Apple TVs are great, but the typical Apple TV remote isn’t the easiest to maneuver. Navigate your Apple TV easier with this Apple TV-compatible remote with traditional buttons, now only $26.97 (reg. $29) until January 14!
While Apple TVs are awesome streaming solutions, its basic remote is notorious for lacking specific functionality and being easy to lose. If you love the sleek look of your Apple TV but miss the feeling of a traditional TV remote, look no further.
The Function101 Button Remote for Apple TV and Apple TV 4K is designed to help, offering a traditional button remote compatible with Apple TVs. It’s now on sale for only $26.97 (reg. $29) through January 14!
This simple accessory is designed with a traditional remote control button design for the modern age, making it more suitable for kiddos and older folks to use comfortably. It has your classic volume button with the plus-and-minus ends and a power button right at the top where it belongs. 




Working with infrared technology, the device requires a line of sight to your Apple TV to function as designed. In terms of distance, it can cover quite a bit. With up to 12 meters of range, the Function101 remote is more than equipped to support most living rooms and households. It’s also designed to be compatible with most television sets, including those with 4K capabilities. 

And as expected, the design of this remote doesn’t require voice commands or endless clicking. It’s supposed to look and feel like the remote control solutions of the cable era, but is designed to be compatible with your Apple TV so you can enjoy all the things you love about it, minus the often tricky-to-use remote.
Don’t settle for an uncomfortable Apple TV experience.
Get the Function101 Button Remote for Apple TV and Apple TV 4K for just $26.97 through January 14 at 11:59 p.m. Pacific. No coupon required!
