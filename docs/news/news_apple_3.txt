New year, new headphones. 
If you’re one of the unlucky many who lost one or both of their AirPods down a sewer grate, or between the train and the platform in the subway, and you didn’t manage to pick up a replacement set this Christmas, it’s high time you consider taking matters into your own hands. 
Lucky for you, there’s no better time to do so than today, which sees Amazon offering Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) at their lowest price ever, just $189.00. 
By now, AirPods seem to be a part of the basic fabric of life, as essential to people’s uniforms as their pants.  Thankfully, Apple has taken notice, and the prices keep dropping. 
This week, pick up a pair of Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation), featuring Active Noise Cancellation for dramatically less noise when you want to focus, personalized spatial audio, and much, much more. 




Apple’s newest model of in-ear headphones, the 2nd Generation AirPods Pro, have all the same features and capabilities as the previous generation, plus many more. With richer audio experience, next-level noise cancellation, and more intuitive controls, all for under $190 today on Amazon.
